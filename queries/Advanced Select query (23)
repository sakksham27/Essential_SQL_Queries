-- Query: Pivot Names by Occupation Using CASE and ROW_NUMBER()
-- Description:
--   This script pivots the OCCUPATIONS table by transforming rows into columns.
--   It arranges names under their respective occupations (Doctor, Professor, Singer, Actor),
--   aligning them by row number to produce a clean, readable grid.
--
--   Steps:
--     1. Assigns a row number (rn) within each occupation group using ROW_NUMBER().
--     2. Uses CASE WHEN inside MAX() to pivot names into separate columns.
--     3. Groups by rn to align corresponding names across occupations.
