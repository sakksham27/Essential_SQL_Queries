# Essential\_SQL\_Queries

This repository is a curated collection of SQL queries Iâ€™ve written and organized while practicing and strengthening my understanding of relational databases and structured query logic. It covers a wide range of query typesâ€”from simple data retrieval to advanced filtering, conditional logic, and string manipulation.

Each query is:

* Professionally formatted and commented for clarity
* Categorized by use case (e.g., filtering, aggregation, joins, string functions)
* Written with clean logic and optimized syntax
* Ready for integration, learning, or technical interviews

## ðŸ“Œ What You'll Find

* Real-world patterns using `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE`, `ORDER BY`, etc.
* Practice problems involving employee records, student data, city demographics, and geometry
* Vowel/consonant logic filtering for names and cities
* Triangle classification with control-flow logic (`CASE WHEN`)
* Consistent documentation and naming standards

## ðŸ›Œ Why This Matters

SQL is the backbone of data analytics, engineering, and backend systems. This repository reflects my commitment to writing clean, efficient, and production-ready SQLâ€”skills I bring to any data-driven role.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies

* SQL (standard SQL syntax, tested on MySQL/PostgreSQL environments)

This repository is continuously updated as I deepen my SQL expertise and explore more complex query patterns. Feel free to clone, adapt, or use this as a reference for interview prep or professional development.
